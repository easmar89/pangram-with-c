# Pangram in C

In this exercise, we explore how to solve the classic pangram problem in C. In higher level languages like Python or JavaScript, one might simply use a data structure like a hashmap (python dict / JS object) or set to store the alphabets and then check for the number of unique characters. However, in C, there are no built-in data structures like hashmaps or sets, which prompts us to look at the problem from a different angle and find solutions in new ways.

## Learning objectives

- Understanding and working with bit sets and bit manipulation.
- Getting more practice with the C language
- Learning how to tackle problems from new perspectives instead of using traditional and standard methods
- Compare the efficiency of solving this problem with C compared to the python solution.

**Python solution:**

```txt
real	0m0,025s
user	0m0,020s
sys	    0m0,004s
```

**C Solution:**

```txt
real	0m0,002s
user	0m0,002s
sys	    0m0,000s
```

> This is one exercise in a series of exercises aiming to learn how things work under the hood, as well as get some practice working with the C language.
